# Implementation of Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment 

This repo reproduct the stucture of a MCC task scheduling algorithm proposed in [Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing
Environment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6973741) with C++. Explicit pseudo codes are also given for each phase of the framework.



### Running environment

* Xcode 


### Using the code

Run `Code.xcodeproj`. The code has already contained some examples in the main function. You can also feed the program with your own task graph through `TaskSchedule` class.
